# What I've leaned:
 - Python script  - a sequence of instructions that is executed by a Python interpreter.
 - Module - a file containing Python definitions and statements. Can be imported into other modules or scripts or main module.
 - `__name__` - a built-in variable that returns the name of the current module.
 - Package - a collection of modules(structured in a certain way).
 - __init__.py - a file that tells Python that the directory should be considered a package.S
